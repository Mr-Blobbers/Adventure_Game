This is a private little project to train my C programming skills.
Will probably redo this in the future either in Java or in Python, maybe both.
May add and change a lot of the features and try to improve them.

#TODO:
Adding more enemy encounters
Adding more scenes
Introducing spells (Other than heal)
Making damage calculations more class specific (Damage bonus for Archer based on dex instead of strength for example)
